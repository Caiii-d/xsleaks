    From <https://fetch.spec.whatwg.org/#http-fetch>:

    """
    4.2 HTTP fetch

    […]

    5. Set response to the result of performing an HTTP network or cache fetch using request with credentials flag if set and authentication fetch flag if set.

    6. If the CORS flag is set and a CORS check for request and response returns failure, return a network error.
    """

    304 is applied to the response in "HTTP network or cache fetch," but you don't allow for the handling of conditional requests there (which all browsers do implement).

    I'd be happy to work on some proposals to fix that, if you're amenable.

    Not sure what's new here — every browser I tested passed the core of that suite. Trying to apply CORS to a 304 pre-cache will not only go against current practice, it'll also cause incompatibility with deployed servers and proxies (as discussed ad nauseum last time around).

    You only get a 304 (legitimately) when you send a conditional request, and the browser will only send a conditional request when it has something in cache — but that thing is stale (hence the conditional request).

    If the client-side code is generating the conditional request and trying to handle the 304 themselves, yes it's a problem (and IIRC we left that as unsolveable last time around).

    IIRC it was the stuff you asked me to add around Access-Control-Expose-Headers.

    Right. And in that case the requesting party sees a 200 (or whatever
    was cached I supposed), not a 304. Looking forward to your suggestions
    on fixing this.

    In that case we should probably require same-origin-or-CORS (the
    current code path). Otherwise we might end up exposing bits in the 304
    response that were not meant to be seen. But I guess we should also
    see what browsers do here if that's not yet covered.

    Ah okay, so browsers fail at combining headers?


https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/issues/97  206 (partial content) / 304 (not modified) handling broken

    https://github.com/whatwg/fetch/pull/141 Update headers upon a 304; fixes #97 

    the underlying issue AFAIK was that response headers weren't updated by the 304. Please explain?
