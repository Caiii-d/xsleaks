\section{XSinator}

To distinguish betweentwo user states, the attackerâ€™s JavaScript code must be able to identify differences in its own execution environment resulting fromdifferent responses to cross-origin HTTP requests. These differentresponses must correspond to different user states at the target webapplication. If this differentiation is possible, we call this vulnerability an XS-Leak. The attacker can then craft a malicious website,which triggers the XS-Leak once the victim opens it (Figure 1). Inthe following two real-world examples, we try to exemplify thescope of the problem
